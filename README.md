TwittosBot is a twitter bot that can do all sorts of things:

The bot can tell if a tweet is being copied. Calculate how many times a user tweets per day on average. 
The number of tweets a user has made today. 
The number of tweets a user made yesterday. 
The number of times a user has said a certain word/phrase and many other things.

The bot has been coded in python using the twitter api and other python modules.
